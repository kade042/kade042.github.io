Programming languages have procedural programming, functional programming and object-oriented programming paradigms. Ruby is an object-oriented language with some functional and procedural features.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design applications and computer programs.

The basic programming concepts in OOP are:

-Abstraction
-Polymorphism
-Encapsulation
-Inheritance

The abstraction is simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.
The polymorphism is the process of using an operator or function in different ways for different data input.
The encapsulation hides the implementation details of a class from other objects.
The inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined.
